### Hello! ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ“ˆ I have an M.S. in Statistical Science from Duke University and interests in statistical computation, open-source software, and data science! 

ğŸš€ I recently interned at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory writing code to simulate failure rates on the Perserverance Rover and Europa Clipper missions.

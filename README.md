### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ“ˆ I'm a second-year MS Statistical Science student @ Duke University with interests in statistical computation, open-source software, and data science! 

ðŸš€ I recently interned at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory writing code to simulate failure rates on the Perserverance Rover. 

âœ… I'm looking for full-time roles in data science and statistics starting in May, so please feel free to reach out if you have opportunities.
